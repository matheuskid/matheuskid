# Hi! I'm Matheus, and I like to do some code! 🖥️ 🔌 📄

## About Me 👇
I'm a computer technician doing my bachelor's degree in Information Systems.<br>
I'm 20-years old, and I'm actualy just focusing on my bachelor, but trying to do some other things whenever I have time, like:<br>

  - Learn C#;
  - Improving my English skills.

I always had an interest in speaking English, as the language that I heard in games, movies, music and other types of media.<br>
Today, I'm into improving my pronunciation, while trying to form thoughts and phrases about everyday things, also trying to speak them out loud.<br>
Furthermore, I'll focus on English for Business, to widen my skills as a professional.
